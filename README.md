#Sentence Autocomplete

It is an efficient model for sentence autocompletion making use of deep learning and natural language processing.

This model is trained on datasets of resumes but it can be used in message autocompletion,while writing paragraphs,resumes etc.

#Technologies Used:
Keras,Tensorflow,Deep learning,pickle,heapq,glob,numpy,nltk,matplotlib

RegexTokenizer is used to extract tokens from regular text.Over 150,444 unique words have been recognised and their most likely following words have been predicted using a combination of Keras layers.
LTSM layer has been used as we are dealing with sequential data along with Dense and Activation layers.
